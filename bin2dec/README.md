### • Description:

-I did this project as a way of training the basic principles of HTML, CSS and JS. The idea was taken from the app-ideas made by Florin Pop(https://github.com/florinpop17).

### • Features:

- [x] User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
- [x] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered
- [x] User can enter a variable number of binary digits

### • Link:

-You can see the final result in [Codepen](https://codepen.io/freitagfelipe/pen/eYgENeM) or in [Netlify](https://aces-bin2dec.netlify.app)
