### • Description:

-I did this project as a way of training the basic principles of HTML, CSS and JS. The idea was taken from the app-ideas made by Florin Pop(https://github.com/florinpop17).

### • Features:

- [x] User can see a pane containing a single image repeated in a 2x2 matrix
- [x] User can flip any one of the images vertically or horizontally using a set of up, down, left, and right arrows next to the image
- [x] User can change the default image by entering the URL of a different image in an input field
- [x] User can display the new image by clicking a 'Display' button next to the input field
- [x] User can see an error message if the new images URL is not found
